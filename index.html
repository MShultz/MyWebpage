            <p class='intro'> Hello! I'm sure you've stumbled onto this little website by no accident. You either want to learn about me, or you're currently looking through all of my content to see how well I did. Its alright; I understand either way, but, while you're here, maybe I should give you some information about myself. On further pages, you can find some more stuff about me, but for starters, I'll just give you the basics.</p>
            
            <ul class='who_am_i'>
                <li class='revised_list'>Who</li>
                <p> My name is <strong>Mary Shultz</strong>!</p>
                <li class='revised_list'>What</li>
                    <p>I am a nine-teen year old female who enjoys a lot of things. Some things include: playing the saxophone, writing, and coding. To see a full list, you can go <a href="interests.html" class="link_in_content">here!</a></p>
                <li class='revised_list'>When</li>
                    <p> I was born on November 21, 1996. As of this page's creation I am: 19 years, 2 months, and 24 days old. There have been 168,624 hours since my birth. (I totally didn't do that math on my own :P) That's pretty cool, I guess, huh?</p>
                <li class='revised_list'>Where</li>
                    <p>I was born and raised in El Dorado Arkansas. This is in the southern part of Arkansas; about thirty minutes away from Louisiana. </p>
                <li class='revised_list'>Why</li>
                <p>Well when a Mommy and a Daddy love each other very much.... I'm just kiding. :) Still, I was born to my mother, Daphane, my father, Bryan, and my sister, Drucilla. <em>My sister and I are 7 years apart.</em></p>
