            <p> I don't have any specific ideas of what I want to do when I graduate from Neumont. I've been thinking over the idea for quite a long time. When I first came here, I thought that I wanted to go into the Software and Game Development program. I've realized, the longer that I've been here, that I enjoy solving problems more than creating something that provides entertainment. When I graduate, although I don't know where I would like to begin, I want to be able to help people with my knowlege.</p>  </div>
           
            <div id='explanation'><p>When I was young, my father passed away. While he left us with enough to survive on, my mother had to work very hard to ensure that I had the life that she wanted me to have. For this reason, a lot of my goals I have set for myself are based around that idea and the want to provide not only for the family I want to have in the future, but the family that has taken care of me in the past.</p></div>
