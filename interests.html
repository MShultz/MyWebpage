                <li class='revised_list'>Music</li>
                    <p>Some would say that I have an odd enjoyment of music. For the most part, my likes range from pop to rock. I have a love for KPop and the sounds of the melodies. Even though I can't understand the words, I really love the emotion behind voices and melodies. I also love some of the more popular artists from the west. Lady Gaga is a favorite of mine; especially the jazz album she released with Tony Bennett.</p>
                <li class='revised_list'>Movies</li>
                    <p>My love of movies really stems from two places. I love apocalypse and horror genre's the most out of anything. While I can get into some other genres (as you can see, two of my favorite Rom-Coms are Korean or French in origin, I truly enjoy some of the more disasterous movies. They keep me more entertained, keep me thinking, and interested. The most recent Godzilla movie is probably my favorite, but I did wish that it had a little bit more of the creature and battles in it. Demons interest me, so many of my favorite horrors are based around demon culture.</p>
                <li class='revised_list'>TV Shows</li>
                    <p>Even before I moved away from home, I wasn't really one for watching television. I've never quite understood the 'Netflix and chill' culture that has been buzzing around for these past few months. Still, when I do watch shows on television, I am a lover of action-filled adventure-type shows. For this reason, BBC's Sherlock and Chunibiyou are at the top of my list. I don't love anime like many other people do, but some cute stories really drag me in no matter what their style or genre.</p>
                <li class='revised_list'>Hobbies</li>
                    <p>During high school, I played Saxophone for my high school marching band. Because of all the fond memories and achievements, playing an instrument has always been very important in my life. Since I came to school, I've found a huge love for code. Since I really love solving problems, using code to fix and simulate real-world events, I find very fun. Cooking and sleeping--along with playing video games--are other loves of mine. Coming from the south, I really love southern foods, and since I can't have them authentically here, I've grown to love cooking them myself.</p>
                <li class='revised_list'>Video Games</li>
                    <p>Like most people, I do have a love for video games. Because of my prioritization of school over games, however, I don't get to work on them as much as I would like. Once again, horror games are a favorite, but I also enjoy a great story. While most people play League of Legends, I enjoy the MOBA Smite for it's more personal level fighting style.</p>
